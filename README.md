# vlsi-toolbox

Ubuntu-based **VLSI / EDA toolbox container** intended for use with **Distrobox**.

This image provides a large, batteries-included environment for digital and mixed-signal VLSI work, including open-source synthesis, simulation, P&R, and layout tools. It is designed to be used *interactively* as a development environment rather than as a minimal runtime container.

## 📦 Image

The image is published on GitHub Container Registry:

```
ghcr.io/xelef2000/vlsi-toolbox
```

### Supported architectures

There are **separate images per architecture**:

* `amd64`
* `arm64`

Examples:

```
v1.1.1-amd64
v1.1.1-arm64
latest-amd64
latest-arm64
```

> ⚠️ **Note**
> There is **no multi-arch manifest**. Each image is already ~8 GB, so architectures are published separately.

## 🐳 Intended usage: Distrobox

This container is meant to be used with **Distrobox**

### Create the container

For **amd64** hosts:

```
distrobox create \
  --name vlsi-toolbox \
  --image ghcr.io/xelef2000/vlsi-toolbox:latest-amd64
```

For **arm64** hosts:

```
distrobox create \
  --name vlsi-toolbox \
  --image ghcr.io/xelef2000/vlsi-toolbox:latest-arm64
```

## ⚠️ Image size

This image is **large** (≈8 GB per architecture).

That is intentional:

* Tools are built from source where required
* GUI support is included
* The goal is *completeness*, not minimal size
